# Vanane's Item Generator
A fancy item generator, for all your tabletop roleplay needs.
## What ?
Vanane's Item Genrator is, you guessed it, an item generator. It generates items. It might sometimes generates you the Livid Crocs Of In-between Darkness, the Compromising Bow Of Avaricious Clothing, or a Wooden Sword.
Nothing fancy, just premade name syntaxes, and blank filling to give you a unique item name.

An example is hosted here : https://vanane-item-gen.herokuapp.com
## But why ?
Good question
## Can I use it, and how ?
If you simply want a quick list to read, just hit https://vanane-item-gen.herokuapp.com. If as a developer, you want it as a JSON result, a simple call to https://vanane-item-gen.herokuapp.com/ajax.php should suffice.

## Can I fork it ?
Sure, do whatever you want with it, change it, destroy it, but don't forget to give credit to the original.
